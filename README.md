# IoT_LinkBudget_TopRed
Link Budget simulation and Topological Reduction Algorithms applied to specific sector and area 

Applied to the area of Durban, South Africa on petrol/gas stations using Google's Places and Elevation API to gather the appropriate data. The Link Budget simulation was done on Radio Mobile (http://www.g3tvu.co.uk/index.htm) and the Topological Reduction Algorithms were created based on pseudo-code from multiple sources. The end result was applied to emulating an IoT network on Cooja (not attached).
